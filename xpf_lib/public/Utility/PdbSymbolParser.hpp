/**
 * @file        xpf_lib/public/Utility/PdbSymbolParser.hpp
 *
 * @brief       In here you'll find functionality for parsing program database (pdb) files.
 *              These files store information useful for debugging a program.
 *              While not properly documented, Microsoft has published the code for generating
 *              such files, and you can find it at https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-pdb
 *              Another very useful resource is the llvm documentation available at
 *              https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/index.html Comments and structure are extracted from
 *              these two sources. So I'd like to extend my thanks to both of these for making the
 *              documentation open. This work would have been infinitely harder without these two
 *              sources.
 *
 * @note        This is not a complete pdb parser as it does not cover all edge cases but rather a
 *              minimalistic one tailor made from public M$ symbols which is useful for decorating
 *              stacks with descriptive symbols. Functionality will be added when it is required.
