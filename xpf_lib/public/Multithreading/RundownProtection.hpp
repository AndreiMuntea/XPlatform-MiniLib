/**
 * @file        xpf_lib/public/Multithreading/RundownProtection.hpp
 *
 * @brief       This implements a rundown protection object.
 *              An object is said to be run down if all outstanding accesses of the object are finished
 *              and no new requests to access the object will be granted.
 *              For example, a shared object might need to be run down so that it can be deleted and
 *              replaced with a new object.
 *              See MSDN for EX_RUNDOWN_REF - as this is inspired on that.
